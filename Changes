Changes
=======

0.20016 24 Dec 2013
  - Update MANIFEST

0.20015 18 Dec 2013
  - Change how constants are handled so that things work with libmecab < 0.99
    (https://github.com/lestrrat/Text-MeCab/pull/9)
  - Allow specifying mecab encoding from environment variable
    PERL_MECAB_TEXT_ENCODING, so that you can do
    (https://github.com/lestrrat/Text-MeCab/pull/7)
 
       PERL_MECAB_TEXT_ENCODING=utf-8 carton install

  - Silence some warnings

0.20014 26 Dec 2012
  - You can now specify the default encpding to be used from command line
    via --encoding flag (https://github.com/lestrrat/Text-MeCab/pull/6):

       perl Makefile.PL --encoding=utf-8

  - Fix author tests (https://github.com/lestrrat/Text-MeCab/pull/5)
  - Fix various Module::Install related stuff
  - Stop generating constants dynamically
  - Better error checking in XS
  - Lots of hackery to run tests on Travis-CI

0.20013 19 Sep 2011
  - tokuhirom + http://kiyotakagoto.blog3.fc2.com/blog-entry-62.html
    remove auto_include
  - Use Module::Install::CheckLib

0.20012 09 Jun 2011
  - Make sure to chdir back to the original directory upon call to
    Text::MeCab::Dict::rebuild() (nekokak)

0.20011 19 Dec 2010
  - Make sure to include Devel::CheckLib in inc
  - Fix typo (tomita)
  - Fix author tests

0.20010 28 Aug 2010
  - Remove left over Path::Class(::File) (nipotan)
  - Fix typo (nipotan)

0.20009 19 May 2010
  - Make sure to expose all the constants proved by Makefile.PL
  - Fix author tests

0.20008 10 May 2010
  - Fixes to work with threaded perl
  - Add tests for memleak and threads
  - Since mecab installed via ports and the like tend to come with
    euc-jp dictionary, change the default encoding in probe_mecab.pl

  Upgrade is strongly recommended if you use threaded perl

0.20007_01 09 May 2010
  - Work with libmecab >= 0.98
  - Reorganize file layout
  - Switch to Module::Install
  - Moved repository to github.com

0.20007 08 Mar 2008
  - Now require mecab.h location. This is used to auto-generate constants.
  - Use Devel::CheckLib on non-Win32 platforms.
    (Various Win32 related patches by Kenichi Ishigaki)
  - Makefile.PL tweaks

0.20006 07 Mar 2008
  - Makefile.PL tweak for Win32. Patched by Kenichi Ishigaki
  - We've also been reported that older libmecab doesn't work with Text::MeCab.
    This is a known issue mainly caused by the fact that I have no access to
    older libmecab in my dev environment. If you know of particular combo
    (libmecab version against a particular feature) that doesn't work, please
    send in patches and reports so we can fix them in future releases

0.20005 06 Mar 2008
  - Now we use sv_setref_pv instead of sv_bless and such. This fixes
    a major leakage that prevented Text::MeCab::Node objects from being
    garbage collected until global destruction time. I have no other
    explanation other than that once I switched to sv_setref_pv, everything
    just worked.
  
    Upgrade from previous 0.2000x versions STRONGLY recommended.

0.20004 10 Jan 2008
  - Text::MeCab::Dict has now been confirmed working with mecab-ipadic-20070801
    * tweak the encoding
    * don't use Text::CSV_XS

0.20003 10 Jan 2008
  - Of course, it's always a good idea to *actually* include the new
    module. Yikes. If you downloaded 0.20002 by some odd chance, please 
    use this release instead.

0.20002 10 Jan 2008
  - Add Text::MeCab::Dict, which is a simple wrapper to work with 
    mecab dictionary. Only supports ipadic.

0.20001 09 Jan 2008
  - Properly use ExtUtils::MakeMaker::prompt() to ask interactive
    questions. Pointed out by David Cantrell.

0.20000 08 Jan 2008
  - No code change. Releasing.

0.20000_01 07 Jan 2008
  - Complete rewrite
    * work with libmecab 0.96
    * rework tests
    * use typemaps wisely
    * default encoding is now utf-8
    * now require Encode

0.17 01 May 2007
  - Fixup stupid Copy() problem.

0.16 16 Apr 2007
  - Change the internal C structure to be thin wrappers around mecab_node_t
  - Implement a node->format() method

0.15 29 Jan 2007
  - 0.14 had upload problems. Repackage.

0.14 28 Jan 2007
  - Fix argument passing to mecab_new(). Reported by Naoki Tomita.

0.13 08 Aug 2006
  - Fix tools/probe_mecab.pl so that there are not spurfulous whitespaces
    around the flags (http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t-tkzw/20060730/p2).

0.12 15 Jul 2006
  - Apply "Poor Puppy" patch from Kenichi Ishigaki (charsbar)
  - Properly ask for the dictionary encoding when running perl Build.PL.
    This will create t/strings.dat with that encoding.

0.11 14 Jul 2006
  - Silence more warnings
  - Force use of -Wall at compilation time

0.10 14 Jul 2006
  - remove spurfuluous parse_wakati.pl
  - remove debug statements
  - silence warnings

0.09 12 Jul 2006
  - "Hey, it's the day before my birthday, but I'm releasing a new module" release
  - Switch default behavior of Text::MeCab when it goes out of scope.
    See "Text::MeCab AND SCOPE" section in Text::MeCab POD.
    This all prompted by post at http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t-tkzw/20060710/p1.
  - Add new Text::MeCab::Node::Cloned to workaround.
  - Add warning about not using cloned node when Text::MeCab goes out of
    scope.

0.08 - 05 Jul 2006
  - Apply suggestions by charsbar when prompting for compile/link options
    for Win32
    (and actually release the changes -- this has been sitting on my SVK
     client for a month)

0.07 - 09 Jun 2006
  - The way we were passing arguments to mecab_new() was totally wrong.
    Fixed.

0.06 - 08 May 2006
  - Require ExtUtils::MakeMaker >= 6.25 to avoid Build.PL being
    executed after Makefile.PL
  - Fix INIT -> PREINIT (reported by charsbar)
  - Fix how XSRETURN_UNDEF was working (reported by charsbar)
  - Fix tools/probe_mecab.pl (reported by charsbar)
  - Use ppport.h.

0.05 - 04 May 2006
  - Fix typos
  - Add tests to MANIFEST. argh.
  - Actually test against libmecab < 0.90. Now tests pass.
  - Bump up version to 0.05 for historical reasons. There was another
    version of Text::MeCab that MAKAMAKA had written which went up to
    0.04.

0.02_03 - 04 May 2006
  - Correct reference counting for prev().
  - Add tests for detatched Text::MeCab::Node.
  - Tweak docs

0.02_02 - 04 May 2006
  - Fix tools/probe_mecab.pl such that it prompts the user for some
    required parameters when installing on Windows.
  - Try fixing Makefile.PL once again.
  - Explicitly make copies of mecab_node_t in the XS, so that you
    can now manipulate the nodes even *after* your instance of
    Text::MeCab has gone away

0.02_01 - 03 May 2006
  - Hey, I didn't know people were going to jump on to this module,
    seriously... 

  - Fix building when using Makefile.PL instead of Build.PL
    (refactor important bits to tools/probe_mecab.pl).
  - Attempt to work with MeCab < 0.90.
  - Move benchmark.pl to tools/benchmark.pl.
  - Fix problem caused by Text::MeCab->new() (no parameters).
  - Add Text::MeCab::MECAB_VERSION to display the mecab version
    we compiled against.

  TODO:
  - Try to at least give out a warning when executing a code like this:

    my $node;
    {
        my $mecab = Text::MeCab->new;
        $mecab->parse("......");
        $mecab = undef;
    }

    for(; $node; $node = $node->next) {
       print $node->surface, "\n";
    }

    I'm having a hard time detecting when a node is deallocated, though.
    we shall see.
    
0.02 - 02 May 2006
  - Accept command line arguments as well as the named parameters in hashref
  - Fixed problem where constants MECAB_ weren't declared int he correct
    namespace.

0.01 - 02 May 2006
  - Initial release.
